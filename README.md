# UwU-Nuker-Bot
This is the UwU discord nuke bot

This bot is for educational purposes only and should not be used in any server without full permission

Pretty simple setup.</br>
Go to replit.com and make a new Node.js replit.</br>
Upload the files into the project</br>
Now just go into `Config.json` and enter in your discord bot token.</br>
You can make your own nuke message if you want but it isnt nescesarry.</br>
Then invite the bot to your server and click the run button in the replit (Make sure the bot was added to the server with admin priveledges)</br>
Type in any channel the `$nuke` command and watch the server implode!

Enjoy!
